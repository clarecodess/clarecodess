Hello! I’m Clare and my journey into tech began at Moringa School. I learned Full Stack Development after several enriching years in project management.

On the frontend, I'm probably building with JavaScript. On the backend, it's probably Python.

Beyond work, you’ll find me dabbling as a home chef, leading my wellness communities—theWellNest or managing the <a href=https://kuvaafrica.org/>Kuva Africa</a> community where I empower other African women with resources in tech, business, leadership and wellness.
